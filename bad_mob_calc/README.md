## üö® The Hidden Crisis in Construction

- **78%** of construction workers experience idle time weekly (Harvard Business School)
- **5.5 hours** weekly spent by PMs searching for project data (FMI Corporation)
- **60-80%** industry-wide mobilization failure rate accepted as "normal"
- **5-20x** cascade effect - true costs far exceed visible direct costs

## üéØ What This Calculator Does

The Bad Mobilization Calculator reveals the complete financial impact of mobilization failures through a three-layer cost analysis:

### Layer 1: Direct Costs
- Labor costs (including 35% burden rate)
- Transportation expenses (fuel + vehicle wear)
- Equipment idle time

### Layer 2: Cascade Costs
- Trade coordination delays
- Schedule compression expenses
- Fixed overhead losses

### Layer 3: Strategic Costs
- Remobilization expenses
- Customer relationship damage
- Future revenue at risk

## üìä How to Use the Calculator

1. **Enter Basic Project Information**
   - Crew size (number of workers)
   - Average hourly rate
   - Distance to job site
   - Project complexity level

2. **Specify Mobilization Failure Details**
   - Hours lost to bad mobilization
   - Equipment daily rates
   - Number of vehicles involved
   - Whether remobilization is required

3. **Add Business Impact Factors**
   - Annual company revenue
   - Customer lifetime value
   - Frequency of bad mobilizations
   - Company overhead rate

4. **Review Your Results**
   - See costs broken down by layer
   - View per-incident and annual impacts
   - Export results as CSV
   - Share analysis with stakeholders

## üî¨ Research-Based Methodology

All calculations are based on industry research:
- **Harvard Business School**: Worker idle time studies
- **FMI Corporation**: Construction productivity research
- **AAA**: Vehicle operating cost data ($0.67/mile fuel, $0.40/mile wear)
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics**: Construction wage benchmarks

### Core Formula
```
Total Cost = DC + CC + FCL + CI + SI + RM + FRL √ó Complexity

Where:
DC = Direct Costs
CC = Cascade Costs
FCL = Fixed Cost Loss
CI = Customer Impact
SI = Schedule Impact
RM = Remobilization
FRL = Future Revenue Loss
```
